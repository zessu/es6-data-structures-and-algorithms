This repository contains some popular Data Structures and Algorithms done in JavaScript ES6.

## Data Structures

According to Wikipedia:

> In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

The following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.

* **Interface** - This represents the set of operation supported by a data structure
* **Implementation** - This provides the definition of algorithms used in the operations of the data structure i.e. it provides the internal representation of the data structure

### Characteristics of a Data Structure
1. **Correctness** - a data structure should implement its interface correctly
2. **Time Complexity** - execution time of operations of a data structure should be as small as possible
3. **Space Complexity** - memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible

## Big-O Notation

This is a theoretical measure of the execution of an algorithm, usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size **n**, which is usually the number of items. Informally, saying some equation `f(n) = O(g(n))` means it is less than some constant multiple of `g(n)`.

It is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big-O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

| Big O Notation | Computations for 10 elements | Computations for 100 elements | Computations for 1000 elements  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **O(1)**       | 1                            | 1                             | 1                               |
| **O(log N)**   | 3                            | 6                             | 9                               |
| **O(N)**       | 10                           | 100                           | 1000                            |
| **O(N log N)** | 30                           | 600                           | 9000                            |
| **O(N^2)**     | 100                          | 10000                         | 1000000                         |
| **O(2^N)**     | 1024                         | 1.26e+29                      | 1.07e+301                       |
